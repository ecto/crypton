COMMENT ON SEQUENCE version_identifier IS
'One sequence to rule them all!

Most tables get their ID numbers from this sequence. There''s no harm in
multiple tables pulling ID numbers from the same sequence.  "God made a lot of
integers" and all that.

In a large horizontally scaling deployment, ID numbers may come from a pool of
dedicated ID servers, using something like the unified ID factory that
Nimbus.io uses (which is inspired by Instragram, which is in turn inspired by
Twitter''s Snowflake.)  For a typical site, a single PostgreSQL sequence
providing 8 byte integers is more than sufficient.
https://nimbus.io/dev/trac/browser/Nimbus.IO/tools/id_translator.py?rev=5f0f3e26389e9fc75c95ddc5de9599eefef0ec7a

What''s useful about having unique integers across the whole population of
tables is that we can pass an encoded from of these intentifiers publicly
(without leaking information about the real ID numbers) by implementing these
functions:

 server side secret keys used by public_id() and internal_id():
     id_aes_key (32 random bytes)
     id_iv_key (32 random bytes)
     id_hmac_key (32 random bytes)

 public_id(internal_id):
    a server side function to make public identifier strings that are encrypted
    and authenticated forms of internal IDs.  internal_id is any 8 byte
    integer.

    This works by encrypting the internal ID with aes256cfb(key=id_aes_key,
    segment_width=8) and including a SHA256 HMAC.

 internal_id(public_id):
    a server side function to authenticate and decrypt a public ID back to an
    internal 8 byte integer ID

In these comments, I will attempt to use "_id" suffix to describe the internal
ID (which is an 8 byte integer) and "_identifier" to describe the public
version of an ID (which is a string.)  Only the server can translate
identifiers to IDs.

These are similar to Nimbus.io''s ID Translator.

COMMENT ON TABLE container IS
'A partition of the object database kept for an application user.
The state of the object database is then built up by appling records
sequentially.

How crypto for containers works:

    containers have session keys (tracked in container_session_key)

        A session key for a container involves 2 keys:
            encryption key (32 random bytes)
            HMAC key (32 random bytes.)

        The session keys are used by the accounts participating in the
        container to encrypt, decrypt, and verify container records.

        This table tracks the creation and succession of keys.  A container
        that''s only used by one user will likely have the same session key
        throughout its use.

        A container shared with many users will typically get a new session key
        (superceding the existing key) whenever a container is unshared with an
        account, so that new records in the container would no longer be
        readable by the unshared account.

    session keys are shared with accounts (in container_session_key_share)

        Critically, the keys themselves are NOT STORED directly in
        container_session_key, but rather stored 1:many in
        container_session_key_share, encrypted to each account that should be
        able to read the records stored with the session keys.

        For every entry in container_session_key, there will be one or more
        records in container_session_key_share.

    container data is a series of records (in container_record)

        The state of the container is built up by the client by applying all
        the container''s records in order.

        Each record is encrypted by applying AES256CFB, w/ a random 16 byte IV,
        and with segment width of 128 bits and simple pkcs7 padding.  The key
        used is the current container_session_key.  An HMAC-SHA256 of the
        resulting ciphertext using the session''s HMAC key is also stored.

    So the process of creating a new container is:
        - determine the container_name_ciphertext: by taking the normalized utf8
            HMAC-SHA256(key=container_name_hmac_key,
                        msg=norm_utf8(name_plaintext)
        - generate container_session keys
            session_key = random(32)
            hmac_key = random(32)
            signature = private_key.sign(
                hmac(key='', msg=session_key + hmac_key).digest())
        - for every account (including the owner) that the container is shared
          with, calculate the container_session_key_share entry.
            session_key_ciphertext is session_key encrypted to to_account_id''s
                public key (using PKCS#1)
            hmac_key_ciphertext is hmac_key encrypted to to_account_id''s
                public key (using PKCS#1)
        - create a transaction
        - add container entry to transaction
        - add container_session_key entry to transaction
        - add one or more container_session_key_share entries to transaction
            (one entry for every account we''re sharing the key with, including
            the container''s creator, as calculated above.)
        - add one or more container_record entries to the transaction
        - (add any other data to the transaction needed, including more
          containers, messages, whatever.)
        - ask the server to complete the transaction
        - handle any errors the server returns regarding completing the
          transactions. (typical errors will involve our local state being too
          old, and needing a refresh/retry.)

across all accounts because collisions are unlikely.

When one user shares a container with another user, or messages another user
referencing a named container, the communication must refer to the container by
name_hmac, since the server should not know (and will have no way to lookup)
containers based on their plaintext names.

The system does not guarantee that deleted container names are recyleable. In

COMMENT ON TABLE transaction IS
'These are application level transactions applied on top of SQL transactions.
Transactions are built up by the application, by way of creating a row in the
transaction table, then adding rows to associated tables
(transaction_add_account, transaction_add_container_record, etc.) to build up
the content of the transaction.  Finally, the application either aborts a
transaction (setting transaction.abort_timestamp) or requests that the
transaction be committed (setting transaction.commit_request_time)

Once a commit is requested, a server side worker will process the transaction.
It will immediately set commit_start_time, committer_hostname, and
committer_pid to indicate that work has started in committing the transaction.

Only one transaction maybe applied concurrently per account (account level
commit lock.)

Only one transaction maybe applied concurrently per container (container level
lock.)  If a transaction modifies many containers, the worker applying the
transaction must get the locks for all containers in consistent sorted order to
avoid deadlock between multiple transactions.  Workers should obtain container
locks before account locks.

For scalability, transactions could be separated away from the rest of the
database (in other words, the database servers providing the transaction
related tables do not need to be the same servers and same database as those
holding the main tables.)  Transactions could be sharded across many database
servers, partitioning perhaps by account_id.  Since transactions are built up
in their own durable database, and applying a transaction is an idempotent
operation, it is also straight forward to further shard a large site database
partitioning by container.

Here are some rules for validating a transaction before committing it:

If a transaction adds an account:
    It must also add exactly one base_keyring.
If a transaction modifies a container through any of the associated tables:
    All records from all tables must have the same
        latest_record_id value.
    That latest_record_id value must match container.latest_record_id.
    Otherwise the transaction cannot be committed, with the error that at least
    this container must be refreshed.
If a transaction deletes a container:
    Similar to above, the deletion action must have latest_record_id matching
    container.latest_record_id.  Otherwise the requestor is told that the
    transaction is out of date with regard to that container.
If a transaction deletes a message:
    It is specifically NOT AN ERROR if that message does not exist or is
    already deleted (i.e. deleting messages does not require strict data
    integrity.)
If a transaction deletes a container_session_key_share:
    It is specifically NOT AN ERROR if that container_session_key_share does
    not exist. (i.e. deleting container_session_key_share does not require
    strict data integrity.)
If a transaction creates a container:
    It must also add a container_session_key for that container.
    It must also add a container_session_key_share for that session key,
    to_account_id pointing to the creator''s account.  (It may add others as
    well.)
If a transaction deletes a container_session_key_share:
    (This happens when a container in unshared.)
    It must also add a new container_session_key for that container.
    It must also add a container_session_key_share for that session key,
    to_account_id pointing to the creator''s of the transaction''s account.
        (It may add others as well.)
    For all accounts that were able to read previous records, it must either
    also delete container_session_key_share for those users, or add new
    container_session_key_share entries for them to read the new session_key.
    In other words, accounts should be able to read all of the container or
    none of it.  You wouldn''t want to change the session_key, and omit adding
    a container_session_key_share for one of the accounts who used to be able
    to read the container.

When a commit worker begins processing a transaction, a first past of
validating all of these rules can be made before we acquire any locks.  Some of
those conditions (such as comparisons to latest_record_id) need to be checked
again after locks are acquired.  Checking the conditions twice, first without
acquiring any locks, probably gives us slower overall commit speed, but may
greatly decrease the worst-case latency by narrowing lock contention.
